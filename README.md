# Implementation of a Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

*Project Motivation*: I created this project to practice basic JavaScript (e.g., loops and conditional statements).

*What I Learned*: 

Key Technologies/Techniques in Brief: JavaScript conditional statements, for loops, while loops, functions

The focus for this project was on using conditional statements, looping structures, and functions. Conceptually, the program was very easy to make! It was just about comparing the user input to the random computer input and deciding the winner (according to standard rock-paper-scissors rules).

However, implementing it took more work than I anticipated. In particular, reducing code duplication and making succinct functions took more thought than I expected. I'll probably come back to this and refactor the code to simplify and reduce the amount of code.
