# Implementation of a Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

## Live Preview:

## Project Motivation:
I created this project to practice basic JavaScript (e.g., loops and conditional statements).

## What I Learned:

Key Technologies/Techniques in Brief: JavaScript conditional statements, for loops, while loops, functions, and DOM manipulation.

Originally, this game was meant to be played in the browser console. Conceptually, it was relatively straightforward and consisted of using a random number generator to create the computer's move and then comparing it using a series of if-else statements with the user input (submitted via a prompt).

I later refactored the program to provide a simple GUI. This introduced DOM manipulation and event handling. This was my first experience refactoring a program and it was much more difficult than I anticipated! I learned a lot about the importance of planning projects out on paper with pseudocode and making succinct functions.

## Next Steps:

As I learn more about code organization, I will revisit this program to refactor it further and make the program clearer. A more immediate goal will be to go back and ensure coherent naming conventions were used.
